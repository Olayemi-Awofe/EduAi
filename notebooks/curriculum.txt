LIGHTER LOAD, STRONGER MINDS: FG OVERHAULS CURRICULUM FOR A SMARTER GENERATION The Honourable Minister of Education, Dr. Maruf Tunji Alausa, CON, alongside the Honourable Minister of State for Education, Professor Suwaiba Sa’id Ahmad, has announced a major review of the national curriculum. The reform is designed to reduce subject overload, promote skill development, and align Nigerian education with global best practices. This landmark decision followed wide consultations with the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (NERDC), WAEC, NECO, NBTE, NABTEB, and other critical stakeholders in curriculum design and assessment. The key changes in the new curriculum include a reduction in the number of subjects across all levels. Pupils in Primary 1 to 3 will now take a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 10 subjects; Primary 4 to 6 will study 11 to 13 subjects; Junior Secondary School (JSS 1–3) will take 12 to 14 subjects; while Senior Secondary School (SSS) will retain 8 to 9 subjects, with a sharper focus on five core areas: Humanities, Sciences, Business, one trade subject, as well as the core and compulsory general courses. The Nigerian Language subject has also been streamlined to only offer the following languages; Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. A new subject, Citizenship and Heritage Studies, has been introduced at the senior secondary level by merging Nigerian History, Civic Education, and Social Studies, while Nigerian History has been reintroduced as a compulsory subject from Primary 1 to JSS 3. Trade subjects for non-technical schools have been streamlined from over 30 to six practical areas: Solar PV Installation and Maintenance, Fashion Design and Garment Making, Livestock Farming, Beauty and Cosmetology, Computer Hardware and GSM Repairs, and Horticulture and Crop Production. In addition, National Business and Technical Examinations Board (NABTEB) will now administer 28 revamped trade subjects for technical colleges. WAEC and NECO subjects have also been aligned to reflect the revised structure, focusing on core areas and relevant trades. Speaking on the reform, Dr. Alausa said the new curriculum, which will take effect in the 2025/26 academic year, will allow children to learn in a more focused and functional way without the burden of too many subjects, while teachers will benefit from a simpler structure, and government resources can be better directed toward building a stronger, skill-driven education system. The Honourable Ministers emphasized that the curriculum overhaul is a testament to the Federal Government's commitment to revitalizing the education sector, enhancing the quality of instruction, and ensuring that Nigerian students are equipped with the knowledge and skills required to thrive in the global economy. The Ministry assures parents, teachers, and students that it will provide the necessary support to ensure a smooth transition to the revised curriculum.
