       "3.  Negative Correlation: Show a scatter plot of \"Hours of Video Games Played vs. Hours of Sleep.\" Explain that as one thing increases, the other tends to decrease. The points generally go down from left to right. This is a negative relationship.\n",

       "       Find \"28\" on the temperature axis (x-axis).\n",
       "       Move your finger straight up until you hit the line of best fit.\n",

       "2.  Distribute Materials: Hand out the \"Line Detective\" worksheet, rulers, and spaghetti noodles.\n",
       "3.  Instructions: The worksheet will feature 3-4 different scatter plots (e.g., Age of a Car vs. Its Value, Minutes of Exercise vs. Resting Heart Rate). For each plot, the students' tasks are:\n",
       "       Part A: Describe the Trend. Write one sentence describing the relationship (e.g., \"This graph shows a negative relationship. As the car gets older, its value goes down.\").\n",
       "       Part B: Draw the Line. Use your ruler to carefully draw a line of best fit through the data points.\n",
       "       Part C: Make a Prediction. Answer a question that requires them to use their line to predict a value (e.g., \"Using your line, predict the value of a car that is 8 years old.\").\n",
       "4.  Teacher Role: Circulate around the room, providing guidance, checking for understanding, and asking probing questions like, \"Why did you decide to draw your line there?\"\n",

       "3.  Using the line on this graph, predict the plant's height at 5 weeks. (Provide a scatter plot of \"Plant Growth\" with a line of best fit already drawn).\n",

       "### 10. Summary / Conclusion\n",
       "(10 minutes)\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Review Exit Tickets: Quickly scan a few student answers to identify any common misconceptions to address immediately.\n",
       "2.  Class Discussion: Ask a few groups to share their findings for one of the problems on the worksheet.\n",
       "3.  Recap Key Concepts: \"Today, we learned how to be data detectives. We learned that scatter plots help us see patterns. We can describe these patterns as positive, negative, or no relationship. To make predictions, we draw a line of best fit to show the trend in the data.\"\n",
       "4.  Real-World Connection: \"Who do you think uses this in the real world? (Businesses predicting sales, scientists studying data, sports analysts tracking player performance).\"\n",

       "\"Data Collector\" Challenge\n",
       "\n",
       "For students who finish early or as a take-home assignment:\n",
       "1.  Choose Your Variables: Pick two things you think might be related (e.g., hours of sleep vs. mood rating the next day (1-10); minutes spent reading vs. pages read).\n",
       "2.  Collect Data: Collect at least 5-7 data points over the next week.\n",
       "3.  Create Your Plot: Draw a scatter plot of your data on graph paper.\n",
       "4.  Analyze: Draw a line of best fit and write a sentence describing what you found. Does your data show a relationship?\n",

       "(For the teacher to consider after the lesson)\n",
       "   Which activity generated the most energy and understanding? Was the \"Human Scatter Plot\" effective?\n",
       "   Did students struggle with the concept of \"no relationship\"? Were the examples clear?\n",
       "   How accurately were students able to draw the line of best fit? Was the spaghetti noodle/ruler technique helpful?\n",
       "   Were the prediction questions on the worksheet and exit ticket at the appropriate level of difficulty?\n",

      "3.  Instructions: The worksheet will feature 3-4 different scatter plots (e.g., Age of a Car vs. Its Value, Minutes of Exercise vs. Resting Heart Rate). For each plot, the students' tasks are:\n",
      "       Part A: Describe the Trend. Write one sentence describing the relationship (e.g., \"This graph shows a negative relationship. As the car gets older, its value goes down.\").\n",
      "       Part B: Draw the Line. Use your ruler to carefully draw a line of best fit through the data points.\n",
      "       Part C: Make a Prediction. Answer a question that requires them to use their line to predict a value (e.g., \"Using your line, predict the value of a car that is 8 years old.\").\n",

      "3.  Recap Key Concepts: \"Today, we learned how to be data detectives. We learned that scatter plots help us see patterns. We can describe these patterns as positive, negative, or no relationship. To make predictions, we draw a line of best fit to show the trend in the data.\"\n",

      "2.  Collect Data: Collect at least 5-7 data points over the next week.\n",
      "3.  Create Your Plot: Draw a scatter plot of your data on graph paper.\n",
