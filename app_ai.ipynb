       "1.  The Prediction Question: Start by asking the class a fun, relatable question: \"If I told you that your classmate spent five hours playing a video game this week, would you predict they are very good or not so good at it? What if they spent 50 hours? Why did your prediction change?\"\n",
       "2.  Introduce the Concept of Relationships: Discuss their answers, guiding them to the idea that we often look for connections or patterns between two things to make a good guess. Explain that in data science, this is called finding a relationship.\n",
       "3.  Visual Brainstorm: On the whiteboard, draw two columns: \"Thing 1\" and \"Thing 2.\" Ask students for pairs of things they think are related.\n",
       "       Examples: Height and shoe size; hours of sunshine and plant growth; speed of a car and time to get to school.\n",
       "4.  State the Mission: \"Today, we are going to be Data Detectives! Our mission is to look at clues (our data), find the hidden pattern, and draw a special tool called a 'Line of Best Guess' to help us predict the future.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Part 1: Introducing the Scatter Plot (15 mins)\n",
       "1.  Introduce the demonstration dataset: \"Hours Spent Practicing Basketball vs. Free Throws Made (out of 10).\"\n",
       "       Sample Data: (1 hr, 3), (2 hrs, 4), (3 hrs, 6), (4 hrs, 7), (5 hrs, 8)\n",
       "2.  Explain the axes on the large grid paper. The horizontal line (x-axis) is for \"Hours Practicing,\" and the vertical line (y-axis) is for \"Free Throws Made.\"\n",
       "3.  \"I Do\": Model how to plot the first data point (1, 3). Think aloud: \"First, I go across the bottom to '1 hour,' then I go up to '3 free throws' and make a dot.\"\n",
       "4.  \"We Do\": Ask students to guide you in plotting the next two points. Have them call out the directions (\"Go across to 2, then up to 4!\").\n",
       "5.  \"You Do\": Have students plot the final two points on their own mini-grids if available, then check with a partner before you reveal the correct placement.\n",
       "\n",
       "Part 2: Finding the \"Line of Best Guess\" (30 mins)\n",
       "1.  Observe the Pattern: With all the points plotted, ask the class: \"What do you notice? As the hours of practice go up, what generally happens to the number of free throws made?\" Guide them to see the upward trend.\n",
       "2.  Introduce the Tool: Explain that a \"Line of Best Guess,\" also called a line of best fit, is a single straight line that shows the main direction of all the data points.\n",
       "3.  The Rules for a Good Line:\n",
       "       It must be a straight line.\n",
       "       It should go through the middle of the points.\n",
       "       It should have roughly the same number of points above it as below it.\n",
       "4.  Demonstrate with Spaghetti: Take a piece of uncooked spaghetti or string. Hold it over the scatter plot. Move it around, showing bad fits (too steep, too flat, not in the middle). Ask the class for feedback: \"Is this a good line? Why or why not?\"\n",
       "5.  Finalize the Line: Settle on the best position and use a ruler to draw the line on the demonstration graph.\n",
       "6.  The Power of Prediction: Show how the line works. Ask: \"According to our line, if a player practiced for 3.5 hours, how many free throws would we predict they would make?\" Trace the line from 3.5 on the x-axis up to your line, and then across to the y-axis to find the \"best guess\" (e.g., around 6.5).\n",

       "#### 8. Learner Activities / Group Work\n",
       "(30 minutes)\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Divide and Conquer: Split the class into small groups of 3-4 students.\n",
       "2.  Distribute Materials: Give each group a worksheet with a blank grid, a ruler, a spaghetti noodle, and a unique, simple dataset.\n",
       "       Group A Dataset: Temperature vs. Popsicles Sold\n",
       "       Group B Dataset: Age of a Puppy (in weeks) vs. Weight (in lbs)\n",
       "       Group C Dataset: Pages Read vs. Minutes Spent Reading\n",
       "3.  Group Task Instructions:\n",
       "       Step 1: Plot Your Data. Work together to carefully plot all your data points on the grid.\n",
       "       Step 2: Find the Pattern. Discuss with your group: \"Is there a relationship? As one thing goes up, does the other go up or down?\"\n",
       "       Step 3: Find Your Line. Use your spaghetti noodle to find the best place for your \"Line of Best Guess.\" Once you all agree, use a ruler to draw it.\n",
       "       Step 4: Make a Prediction. Your worksheet will have a question like, \"Based on your line, how many popsicles would you predict are sold on a 95°F day?\" Use your line to find the answer.\n",
       "4.  Teacher Role: Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions and checking for understanding. Help groups that are struggling to place their line.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 9. Assessment / Evaluation Questions\n",
       "(15 minutes)\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Group Presentations: Have one or two groups come to the front to briefly share their scatter plot, their line, and the prediction they made.\n",
       "2.  Exit Ticket (Individual Assessment): Give each student a small slip of paper with two questions:\n",
       "       Question 1: Show a scatter plot with a clear upward trend. Ask: \"Does this graph show a positive relationship, a negative relationship, or no relationship?\"\n",
       "       Question 2: Show another scatter plot. Ask: \"Use your pencil and ruler to draw the 'Line of Best Guess' on this graph.\"\n",
       "       Question 3: Using the graph from Q2, ask: \"If x is 7, what is your best guess for y?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 10. Summary / Conclusion\n",
       "(5 minutes)\n",
       "\n",
       "   Recap the key vocabulary: Scatter Plot, Relationship/Pattern, and Line of Best Guess.\n",
       "   Reiterate the main idea: \"We learned that we can turn numbers into a picture—a scatter plot—to see a pattern. By drawing a 'Line of Best Guess' through the middle of our data, we gain the power to make smart predictions about things we haven't even measured yet. This is a fundamental tool that data scientists use every day!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 11. Extension Activity or Homework\n",
       "   Extension (For Early Finishers): Provide a challenge dataset that has a negative relationship (e.g., Hours of TV Watched vs. Test Score). See if they can apply the same steps to find a downward-sloping line.\n",
       "   Homework: \"Be a Data Detective at Home!\" Students are asked to find two things they think are related and collect 5-7 data points. For example:\n",
       "       Time they go to bed vs. how tired they feel the next morning (on a scale of 1-5).\n",
       "       Number of people at the dinner table vs. how long it takes to clean up.\n",
       "       They should bring their data to the next class, ready to plot.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 12. Teacher Reflection Tips\n",
       "(For the teacher to consider after the lesson)\n",
       "\n",
       "   Engagement: Were the sample datasets relatable and interesting to the students? Did the \"Data Detective\" theme resonate with them?\n",
       "   Understanding: Which part was most challenging for students: plotting the points, understanding the \"middle\" of the data, or using the line to predict?\n",
       "   Pacing: Was 120 minutes an appropriate amount of time? Where did I need to speed up or slow down? Should this be split into two days next time?\n",
       "   Materials: Did the spaghetti noodles help students visualize the line, or were they more of a distraction? Were clear rulers effective?\n",
       "   Future Improvements: How can I make the connection between this activity and real-world data science more explicit next time? (e.g., Show a quick news graphic that uses a trend line)."
